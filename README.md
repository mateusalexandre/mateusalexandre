### Hi there!  🚀

My name is Mateus Alexandre from Brazil (brazil). I love constructing beautiful interfaces and architecting applications from the ground-up. I'm primarily focused on web development and enjoy working with JavaScript, Ember.js and SASS.

Outside of development, I'm also interested in UI/UX, Growth Hacking.

Would you like to find me?
